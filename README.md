- **Access their Personal Development Plan (PDP):** Track milestones, reflections, and learning goals.

- **Participate in interactive quizzes:** Test knowledge, track mastery, and identify areas for improvement.  
- **Join youth mentorship programs:** Receive guidance from mentors and mentor younger learners.  
- **Track active SDG or entrepreneurship projects:** Monitor progress and points earned for milestones.

- **View progress and earn badges:** Track growth and achievements through ranks like Beginner, Impact Fellow, and SDG Mentor.  
- **Interact with AI-powered chatbots:** Receive guidance, identify learning challenges, and get tips for improvement.  
- **Self-assess to identify challenges:** Students respond to prompts such as:  
  1. Insecurity in learning environment (bullying, harassment, unsafe conditions)  
  2. Lack of qualified teachers (inexperienced or undertrained teachers, especially in STEM)  
  3. Boring teaching methods (memorization-focused, lack of creativity)  
  4. Lack of mentorship (no guidance, follow-up, or feedback)  
  5. Lack of understanding of personal needs, interests, learning style & language  
  6. Lack of adequate foundation and understanding of subjects  

These self-assessments help the app, mentors, and parents **understand student struggles** and provide **personalized support**.
